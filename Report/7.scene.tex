\section{Scene}
%% analyzing the real object
The object was placed on a desk in the reference image.

%% describing the implementation
The desk was reconstructed using a simple square patch and textured with a wooden texture taken from Pixar One Twenty Eight \cite{pixar2018} using PxrTexture.
The camera is rotated slightly downwards to show the top of the cap.
