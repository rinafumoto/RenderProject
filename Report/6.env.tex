%% analyzing the real object
The reference images were taken indoor with natural light coming from windows.

%% describing the implementation
To recreate the similar environment, I looked for an indoor HDRI with no artificial light. After trials with various HDRIs, I decided to use a studio HDRI from PolyHaven \cite{polyhaven2022} shown in figure \ref{fig:hdri} and included in the scene using PxrDomeLight.
